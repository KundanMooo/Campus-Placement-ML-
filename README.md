# Student Placement Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting the placement possibility of students based on various factors and attributes provided in the dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is named 'Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv'.
- It contains information about students, including academic performance, placement status, and other relevant attributes.
- The dataset is divided into categorical and numerical columns.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The EDA process includes data visualization, handling missing values, exploring the distribution of features, and understanding the relationships between variables.
- Visualizations include bar plots, count plots, box plots, violin plots, and more to gain insights into the data.

## Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, label encoding categorical variables, and one-hot encoding.
- Outliers are also removed from the data using Z-score.

## Machine Learning Models
- Three machine learning algorithms are applied to predict placement status:
  1. Decision Tree Classifier
  2. Random Forest Classifier
  3. Logistic Regression

## Model Evaluation
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC-ROC scores.


## Conclusion
- This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict student placement based on various attributes.
- The best-performing model and its evaluation metrics are provided in the notebook.
- Further optimizations and feature engineering may enhance the predictive accuracy.
